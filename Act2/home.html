                    <p>I am an IT Professional with 5 years of experience. I spent the first 2 years as IT support staff, followed by 3 years in Quality Assurance. Now, I'm eager to upskill by diving into frontend development. Learning how to create engaging user interfaces will not only enhance my technical expertise but also improve my ability to collaborate with developers and ensure high-quality products. I'm excited to expand my skill set and contribute more effectively to our projects.</p>
